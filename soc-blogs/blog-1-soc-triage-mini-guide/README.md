### 📝Blog 1: How SOC Analysts Actually Triage Alerts — A Real-World Mini Guide


How SOC Analysts Actually Triage Alerts — A Real-World Mini Guide updatesupdates🚀
Security Operations Center (SOC) work looks dramatic from the outside, but the real core of a Tier-1 analyst’s job is simple: triage alerts. Every day, analysts decide which alerts matter, which ones don’t, and which ones need escalation. This mini-guide breaks down how real SOC triage works — the exact workflow used in most companies, without buzzwords or overcomplication.
🚀

------------

## ✨1. What Is Triage? ✨
Triage is the process of quickly evaluating an alert to decide:

    . Is this real or a false positive?

    . How serious is it?

    . Does it require escalation?

    . What evidence do we have?

Tier-1 analysts are not responsible for solving incidents. Their job is to filter, verify, and forward the important ones. Good triage means combining speed, accuracy, and clean notes.

------------


## 🆕2. Alert Severity Classification
Most SOCs follow a simple severity model:

    Low: Harmless activity, user mistakes, benign scans

    Medium: Suspicious behavior worth a small investigation

    High: Likely malicious — needs escalation
  
    Critical: Confirmed active attack (ransomware, privilege escalation, multiple hosts)

A key part of triage is rechecking severity because SIEM/EDR tools often mislabel alerts.

## 💡3. Triage Workflow: Identify → Investigate → Decide → Document
This is the real daily workflow of Tier-1 analysts.


## Step 1 — Identify 👷
Understand what triggered the alert.
Check:

    Alert name

    Source (EDR, SIEM, firewall, AV)

    User involved

    Host involved

    Timestamp

    Rule/triggers

This step usually takes 10–20 seconds.

-----

## Step 2 — Investigate 👷
Collect basic evidence to understand context.

Common checks:

    Windows/Linux logs

    Recent user activity

    Process tree

    Network connections

    Command executed (PowerShell/Bash)
 
    Past alerts for same user/IP

    Any matching IOCs

Tier-1 investigation is quick and structured, not deep forensics.

----

## Step 3 — Decide (False Positive or Suspicious?) 🔥
You decide based on evidence:

    Does the behavior match common attack patterns?

    Is this normal for this user or machine?

     Is the command/process suspicious?

     Any relevant IOC?


Decision outcomes:

          False Positive → close with notes

          Suspicious → escalate

          Confirmed malicious → escalate immediately


----

## 🔥Step 4 — Document
Documentation is half of a SOC analyst’s job.
A good ticket includes:

             Timeline
 
             What logs were checked

             What was found

             Reason for closure or escalation

             Summary in simple language

             Analyst name

Clear notes help Tier-2 analysts respond faster.

## 📌4. Common Alert Types in Real SOC Environments


1) Suspicious PowerShell 🛠
Triggered when PowerShell runs encoded or unusual commands.
Examples that raise flags:

             -enc (Base64)

             IEX (execute remote script)

             Hidden window execution
Often many false positives because admins also use these commands.

----

2) Failed Logons (Event 4625) 🛠
Repeated failed login attempts might indicate:

           brute-force attack

           compromised password attempts

But 80% of the time, users just typed the wrong password.
 
----

3) RDP Brute Force Attempts 🔧
Many RDP failures from one IP or country.
Could be malicious scanning or misconfigured automation.
Tier-1 must verify before escalating.

---------

4) Malware Detection Alerts ✏️
Generated by antivirus/EDR.
Usually High severity.
Analyst checks:

            file hash

            process tree

            quarantine action
If suspicious → escalate immediately.

## 🕵️5. How Escalation Works
Tier-1 analysts do not fix attacks.
Their role is to forward important cases with clear evidence.

Escalation includes:

            Summary of suspicious activity

            All logs checked

            Screenshots or artifacts

            Why escalation was necessary

           Recommended category (malware, brute-force, etc.)

Tier-2 continues deeper investigation.

## 🌀6. Example Case: Suspicious PowerShell Execution

Below is a clean example that demonstrates triage without being too long.






Alert: PowerShell executed with Base64 encoded command
Host: WIN-23A
Severity: Medium

Step 1 — Identify 🕵️
    Alert triggered by EDR due to encoded command usage (-enc).


Step 2 — Investigate 🕵️

         Sysmon shows PowerShell ran from winword.exe → highly unusual

        Command includes IEX + remote script URL

        User reports not running PowerShell

        No similar alerts in past for this host


Step 3 — Decide 🚨
Behavior matches malicious execution pattern.
Treat as real threat.


Step 4 — Document & Escalate 🗒
Escalated to Tier-2 with logs, timeline, parent-process chain, and recommendation for threat-hunting across similar hosts.
