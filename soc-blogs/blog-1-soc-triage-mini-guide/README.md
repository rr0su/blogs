Blog 1: How SOC Analysts Actually Triage Alerts — A Real-World Mini Guide


How SOC Analysts Actually Triage Alerts — A Real-World Mini Guide
Security Operations Center (SOC) work looks dramatic from the outside, but the real core of a Tier-1 analyst’s job is simple: triage alerts. Every day, analysts decide which alerts matter, which ones don’t, and which ones need escalation. This mini-guide breaks down how real SOC triage works — the exact workflow used in most companies, without buzzwords or overcomplication.

------------

1. What Is Triage?
Triage is the process of quickly evaluating an alert to decide:

. Is this real or a false positive?

. How serious is it?

. Does it require escalation?

. What evidence do we have?

Tier-1 analysts are not responsible for solving incidents. Their job is to filter, verify, and forward the important ones. Good triage means combining speed, accuracy, and clean notes.

2. Alert Severity Classification
Most SOCs follow a simple severity model:

  Low: Harmless activity, user mistakes, benign scans

  Medium: Suspicious behavior worth a small investigation

  High: Likely malicious — needs escalation

  Critical: Confirmed active attack (ransomware, privilege escalation, multiple hosts)

A key part of triage is rechecking severity because SIEM/EDR tools often mislabel alerts.

3. Triage Workflow: Identify → Investigate → Decide → Document
This is the real daily workflow of Tier-1 analysts.


Step 1 — Identify
Understand what triggered the alert.
Check:

   Alert name

   Source (EDR, SIEM, firewall, AV)

   User involved

   Host involved

   Timestamp

   Rule/triggers

This step usually takes 10–20 seconds.

-----

Step 2 — Investigate
Collect basic evidence to understand context.

Common checks:

  Windows/Linux logs

  Recent user activity

  Process tree

  Network connections

  Command executed (PowerShell/Bash)

  Past alerts for same user/IP

  Any matching IOCs

Tier-1 investigation is quick and structured, not deep forensics.

----

Step 3 — Decide (False Positive or Suspicious?)
You decide based on evidence:

  Does the behavior match common attack patterns?

  Is this normal for this user or machine?

  Is the command/process suspicious?

  Any relevant IOC?


Decision outcomes:

          False Positive → close with notes

          Suspicious → escalate

          Confirmed malicious → escalate immediately


----

Step 4 — Document
Documentation is half of a SOC analyst’s job.
A good ticket includes:

             Timeline
 
             What logs were checked

             What was found

             Reason for closure or escalation

             Summary in simple language

             Analyst name

Clear notes help Tier-2 analysts respond faster.

4. Common Alert Types in Real SOC Environments


1) Suspicious PowerShell
Triggered when PowerShell runs encoded or unusual commands.
Examples that raise flags:

             -enc (Base64)

             IEX (execute remote script)

             Hidden window execution
Often many false positives because admins also use these commands.

----

2) Failed Logons (Event 4625)
Repeated failed login attempts might indicate:

           brute-force attack

           compromised password attempts

But 80% of the time, users just typed the wrong password.
 
----

3) RDP Brute Force Attempts
Many RDP failures from one IP or country.
Could be malicious scanning or misconfigured automation.
Tier-1 must verify before escalating.

---------

4) Malware Detection Alerts
Generated by antivirus/EDR.
Usually High severity.
Analyst checks:

            file hash

            process tree

            quarantine action
If suspicious → escalate immediately.

5. How Escalation Works
Tier-1 analysts do not fix attacks.
Their role is to forward important cases with clear evidence.

Escalation includes:

            Summary of suspicious activity

            All logs checked

            Screenshots or artifacts

            Why escalation was necessary

           Recommended category (malware, brute-force, etc.)

Tier-2 continues deeper investigation.

6. Example Case: Suspicious PowerShell Execution

Below is a clean example that demonstrates triage without being too long.






Alert: PowerShell executed with Base64 encoded command
Host: WIN-23A
Severity: Medium

Step 1 — Identify
Alert triggered by EDR due to encoded command usage (-enc).


Step 2 — Investigate

         Sysmon shows PowerShell ran from winword.exe → highly unusual

        Command includes IEX + remote script URL

        User reports not running PowerShell

        No similar alerts in past for this host


Step 3 — Decide
Behavior matches malicious execution pattern.
Treat as real threat.


Step 4 — Document & Escalate
Escalated to Tier-2 with logs, timeline, parent-process chain, and recommendation for threat-hunting across similar hosts.

Conclusion

Triage is the backbone of daily SOC work. When analysts quickly identify, investigate, decide, and document alerts, the entire security workflow becomes efficient. This guide captures the exact approach used by real SOC teams and provides a practical overview of Tier-1 responsibilities.
