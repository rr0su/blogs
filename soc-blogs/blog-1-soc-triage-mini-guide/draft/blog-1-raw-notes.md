## 📝How SOC Analysts Actually Triage Alerts — A Real-World Mini Guide📝

## 🗒Goal of the Blog

Show realistic Tier-1 SOC workflow:
alert → verify → investigate → decide → document → escalate (if needed).

## ⚡1. What Triaging Actually Means (notes)

Not “solve everything”

First-pass analysis

Validate if alert is real, false positive, or needs escalation

Reduce noise

Provide clean context for Tier-2

Fast + consistent decision-making

-----
--------------------


## ⚡2. How Alerts Enter SOC (notes)

SIEM (Splunk, Sentinel, QRadar, ELK)

EDR (Defender, CrowdStrike, SentinelOne)

Firewall alerts

Email security (Phishing tools)

Identity platforms (Azure AD, Okta)

Alert contains: timestamp, user, host, detection rule, event data.

-----

## ⚡3. Severity Levels (realistic)

Critical — Active exploitation, malware execution, privilege escalation
High — Suspicious PowerShell, lateral movement indicators
Medium — Failed logons, unusual login location
Low — Noise, repeated benign events, housekeeping alerts

-----

## ⚡4. Standard Triage Steps (Tier-1 reality check)
 
Step 1: Identify💡

    What triggered the alert?

    Which rule fired?

    What asset? (server, workstation)


Step 2: Investigate (quick checks) 🌀

    Look at user context

    Look at device history

    Check frequency of similar alerts

    Parse logs (parent process, command-line, network connections)


Step 3: Decide 🎯

    Noise?

    Suspicious but not confirmed malicious?

     Confirmed malicious?
   
    Needs escalation? (privileged accounts, lateral movement signs)


Step 4: Document 📝

    Summary

    What you checked

    Why you took decision

    Evidence (event IDs, timestamps)

## ⚡5. Common Alerts

🤖Suspicious PowerShell

    – Encoded commands
    – DownloadString
    – Parent = WINWORD.exe / EXCEL.exe



🧩Failed Logons

    – Repeated failures
    – Across many hosts
    – From weird geolocation



🗑RDP Brute-Force

     – Multiple source IPs
     – Repeated Event ID 4625
     – Unknown external source



 🚨Malware Detection

    – EDR quarantined file
    – Suspicious executable in temp folder
    – User reports popup


-----------

## 🕵️6. Example Case (simple)

Alert: “Suspicious PowerShell Execution”
Log shows:
            powershell.exe -enc JAB3AG… (base64)

 Tier-1 Actions:

    Decode base64

    Check parent process → WINWORD.exe

    Look for URL in script

    Check if user opened phishing email

    Decide → escalate to Tier-2

## 💣7. When to Escalate

Privileged accounts involved

Possible lateral movement

Payload/download detected

Persistence indicators

Command-and-control callbacks

Anything unclear but suspicious

## 📝8. Documentation Template
```css
Alert: Suspicious PowerShell
Host: DESKTOP-01
User: non-privileged
Summary: base64 encoded command launched by WINWORD.exe
Checks Performed: parent, cmdline, timeline, user history
Decision: Escalated
Reason: Possible malicious macro execution
Evidence: Event IDs, decoded script snippet
```
